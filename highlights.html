      <h2>What is CDS?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Critical Design Strategy (CDS)</strong> comprises three sequential stages:
        <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>Detail</strong>, and <strong>Review</strong>.
        Each stage guides the appraiser through a structured critique of a visualisation artefact, helping them think critically,
        reflect deeply, and identify opportunities for design improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person conducting the critique is the <strong>appraiser</strong>—often the designer or developer of the visualisation.
        The subject of critique is the <strong>artefact</strong>, which might be a sketch, dashboard, interactive tool, physicalisation,
        or poster. It presents <strong>data</strong>, is designed for a <strong>user</strong>, and may involve contributions
        from multiple roles such as <strong>designer</strong> and <strong>developer</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a single individual performs all these roles—for example, a student may design, implement, and appraise their
        own visualisation using the CDS.
      </p>
   
      
      <ul >
        <li><strong>1. Overview</strong><br/>
          After preparing the artefact, the appraiser gives it a name, summarises its essence, and holistically critiques it by selecting five descriptive words from a fixed list.
        </li>
           <li><strong>2. Detail</strong><br/>
         The appraiser conducts a thorough critique by responding to 30 heuristic questions across six perspectives.
        </li>
           <li><strong>3. Review</strong><br/>
         Finally, the appraiser reflects on both the overall critique and the detailed analysis to identify the next steps.
        </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Stage 1: Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The first stage helps the appraiser build a deep understanding of the challenge and context, preparing for critique by reviewing the artefact, data, and task. 
        The appraiser then assigns a short name and summarizes the essence of the design. 
        Finally, they select <strong>five words</strong> from a set of twenty to capture their initial holistic impression. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name the artefact</strong> – create a short, meaningful title (2–3 words).</li>
        <li><strong>Summarise its essence</strong> – a brief description or theme.</li>
        <li><strong>Select 5 impression words</strong> – e.g., “beautiful”, “confusing”, “useful”.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stage 2: Detail</h2>
      <p>
        This stage involves a comprehensive critique across <strong>30 heuristic questions</strong>, structured into six key perspectives:
        <strong>User</strong>, <strong>Environment</strong>, <strong>Interface</strong>, <strong>Components</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, and <strong>Visual Marks</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each question is scored on a Likert scale (from -2 to +2) to represent quality or suitability, and serves as both a reflection guide and evaluation tool.
        Responses can be compiled into a report or summary of findings.

      <h2>Stage 3: Review</h2>
      <p>
        The final stage focuses on <strong>synthesis and reflection</strong>. The appraiser calculates an overall score (e.g., average of Likert scores), revisits initial impressions, and evaluates strengths and weaknesses across the six perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on this reflection, the appraiser identifies <strong>next steps</strong> – such as redesigning, refining layout or interface, or planning usability testing or user feedback. 
        This stage ensures insights are actionable and valuable for improving the artefact.
